Build scripts for some thingies in ThirdPartyStuff require ILMerge to be installed and put into PATH.
Please, keep in mind that those scripts use ILMerge updated for .NET framework 4.0, so your version might work incorrectly.
To exclude possbiel problems with backward/forward compatibility, I put working ILMerge installation next to this readme.
